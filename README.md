### Projects

My work explores environmental variability and animal movement. Projects here link the broad-scale patterns that emerge in remote sensing data with wildlife observations gathered from field surveys, public databases, and satellite tracking devices.  

### Short Biography

I'm a Future Investigator in NASA Earth and Space Science and Technology (FINESST). My doctoral research has focused on how shorebirds navigate shifting wind and water regimes during their spectacular, globe-trekking migrations. I'm interested in how life on Earth has adapted to dynamic environments and why the unprecedented changes that are underway right now might be limiting population persistence. I'm also interested in developing open-access tools that can help us monitor and sustain biodiversity.
